Contributions are always welcome and highly appreciated. Please follow the guidelines below.

The contributions are welcome in the form of 

- Bug reports/fixes
- New performance metrics
- Documentation improvements
- New features

If you add a new feature performance metric, you must add it for both the functional and class-based api, then write
the tests with multiple inputs for the metric. Also make sure that you add its documentation under docs directory
and also specify it's type (either ``min`` or ``max``) in utils.py and then add its name in app.py file.

If you add a new feature, make sure to run the tests and ensure that they pass before submitting a pull request.
